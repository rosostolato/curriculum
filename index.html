              I am passionate about programming and automation. I always try to
              update myself and be dynamic. I have extensive experience in
              freelance and corporate projects. Among them I can mention two in
              particular: software development using AI for automatic capture of
              photos in underwater inspection videos; management system for
              projects and internal operations, both in the company Fugro
              Brasil.<br /><br />
              I'm a fan of novelties and I like to venture into revolutionary
              frameworks. Lately, I developed a mobile system using Flutter, the
              new Google framework, which is currently published in the Apple
              Store and Google Play stores.
